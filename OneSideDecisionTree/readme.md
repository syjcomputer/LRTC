# OneSideDecisionTree
This project aims to calculate risk features.

To obtain risk features, you need to run the script ```python decision_tree_rules```. 

Before run this script, you need to configure something in the head of the file ```decision_tree_rules.py```.

This project will produce a file named ```decision_tree_rules_clean.txt``` saved in {source_dataset}_output/1.0
